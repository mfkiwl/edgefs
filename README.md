# Reliance Edge

Reliance Edge is a small, portable, highly reliable power-fail safe file system
for resource-constrained embedded systems like microcontrollers.  It is written
in C and provides a familiar POSIX-like file system API, making it easy to use
in your application; or an alternate minimalist API if your application has
simple storage needs.  Reliance Edge is highly configurable and can be tuned to
the precise needs of your application.
